## Test your current password
You can confirm the security of your current password using various services online. Be very careful to only use reputable tools that work in the browser and DO NOT send data to a server.

You can also test a password very similar to yours by substituting letters/numbers/marks/uppercase/lowercase close to those you really use. This allows you to confirm with no danger.
